An interactive guide to learning Rust!

- It requires you to look at the [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)!
- It requires you to search the [web](http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=rust).
- It requires you to ask for help on [IRC](https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-beginners).

## Requirements:
- Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

## Tools
[`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is Rust's package manager and part of the Rust instalation.
You can use it to access public packages on https://crates.io, create new packages 
or [format](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) your code.

## Steps:
The goal is to fix/enhance the piece of code in each branch. Start at branch `step1` (default branch after checking out).

- Try to get the program to compile at each step. You can use `cargo run`, [`cargo watch`](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch) or `cargo watch -x run` to achieve that feat.
- Once the program compiles move onto the next branch `step1` -> `step1.1` -> `step2` -> `step2.1` -> `step3`.
- If you get stuck, try the docs, web, or IRC.

### Answers
Yes the answers can be found in the branch `answer`. Try not to cheat; you wont learn!
Asking on [IRC](https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-beginners) is preferable to cheating.
